Some more time and consideration have been taken into figuring out the metaphysical structure of the Multiverse, and I came up with a brilliant idea for configuring the structure of the Multiverse Web, based on, believe it or not, mathematics. I've been asking myself for some time on how I would figure out how many worlds go on each string of the Multiverse Web, and I came up with a clever solution that involves basing the lower bound on each ring on powers of two. If I count the center of the Multiverse as ring number zero, then by allowing at least 2^(n+1) worlds per ring, that means I have two worlds at the center, and these can correspond to the Overworld and Underworld respectively! I like the idea of keeping this idea around to determine a lower bound, so I can be more decisive when making determinations about this in the future. For the time being, I want to take a break from playing with the Multiverse Structure, and for the time being, leave details nondeterministic elsewhere where I haven't covered ground, since the structure of the outer multiverse of Eperia does not affect the world itself, or at least not yet.
