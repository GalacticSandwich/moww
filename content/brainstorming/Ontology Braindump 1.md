Something that has been on my mind for a while has been how many types of sentients exist inside the Eperia Conworld's Universe, and my main intention has been to distinguish them by original substance, that is, the substance that the Creator used to make them. There are two main groups I envisioned as existing within the universe to start, the mortal sentients, consisting of species like the Melians, being made out of dirt, earth, and clay, and the overseers, being made of light and fire. 
## Beings of Light and Fire
The Overseers, also called the Daemons are sentient beings that were created from Light and Fire, and are similar in nature to a combination of angels, demons, and jinn. These live in the Celestial Realm, in a world that is said to have a bright sky, and surfaces made of clouds, on several scattered planets, just like the Eperian Sentients in the Terrestrial Realm.
## Beings of Earth and Clay
Several species of sentient beings, having descended from the original peoples on Eperia, were created from Earth and Clay. These live on several planets, mainly Eperia, situated in the Terrestrial Realm, in a world not to dissimilar to our world.
